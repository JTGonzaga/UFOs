# UFOs
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using javascript, html, and css to display UFO sightings. Originally, our data was only able to be filtered by date using a filter button. This left a lot to be desired so search boxes for country, state, city, and UFO shape were added.
### Results
Utilizing javascript and css, I was able to create a webpage that I think is both aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use. This is what you'll see when you open the webpage.

All of the data we have for UFO sightings is on the webpage and able to be scrolled through, but to make things easier to access I've added text boxes for country, state, city, and UFO shape. These text boxes can be typed in and searched to gather more specific results. All the text boxes are easily seen to the left of the site under the Filter Search header.

This website should be straightforward and easy to navigate by anyone who wants to look at UFO sightings!
### Summary
Unfortunately, I see a few drawbacks to this website.
* The search is case sensitive
